PINHOLE CAMERA FORMULA
which relates an objectâ€™s real-world width, its width in pixels, and the camera's focal length. here's the simple idea:

ðŸ”· formula used:
distance = (real_width Ã— focal_length) / pixel_width

ðŸ”¹ in this project:
real_width = 2.5 meters (assumed average width of a car)

focal_length = 300 (a fixed tuning value based on camera setup)

pixel_width = width of the detected bounding box of the vehicle

ðŸ”¹ what happens:
yolo detects the vehicle and gives its bounding box.

we take the width of that box (in pixels).

apply the formula above to calculate the estimated distance in meters.
